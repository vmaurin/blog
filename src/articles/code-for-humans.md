# Code for Humans

## Intro

In the early days of computing, programmers were writing code in the machine languages.
Code was holes in punch cards, that required documents and comments to understand what was going on.

During the 60s and 70s, new languages and paradigms have introduced variables, procedures, objects,
functions so programmers were able to put names and structure the code in a more meaningful way.

Since this era, new languages have emerged, refining these concepts, improving the structure or
easing the coding work.

However, computers nowadays are still working in similar ways that the first computers.
For a machine, a program is still a set of instructions to execute sequentially. 

All the programming language's evolutions are made for the programmers, not for the machine. When
you are writing code, you are writing code for human beings (including yourself).

The code must be comprehensive, simple, exposing clearly the intent.


* You code for Humans (yourself, coworker, future) so the goal is to make it expressive

* => writing for Humans is something old with tons of advices

* It is impossible to write a good code, you have to iterate
* Start with a draft, have an overall plan
* Read back yourself
* The refactorings :
  * naming
  * extract functions
  * remove duplication
  * review the structure
* The automated tests are enabling that
* Tests are code too
* Peer review (good enough)

* Code that doesn't need to be expressive
